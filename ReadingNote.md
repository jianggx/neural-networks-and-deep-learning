## overfitting 

In general, one of the best ways of reducing overfitting is to increase the size of the training data. 

 weight decay or L2 regularization. The idea of L2 regularization is to add an extra term to the cost function, a term called the regularization term. 

### Artificially expanding the training data
 The general principle is to expand the training data by applying operations that reflect real-world variation.
